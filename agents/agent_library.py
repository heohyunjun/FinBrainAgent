            For each dataset received, follow these steps:
            1. Identify the data type (e.g., stock news as a list of strings, economic indicators as a list of dictionaries) based on its structure.
            2. Apply relevant cleansing tools:
               - For all datasets: Remove duplicates using `remove_duplicates` and standardize dates to YYYY-MM-DD using `standardize_dates` (default key: 'date').
               - For numeric data (e.g., CPI, PCE, income): Convert strings to floats using `normalize_numbers` and replace missing values (e.g., 'N/A', None) with defaults using `handle_missing`.
               - For outlier detection: Use `detect_outliers` on key numeric fields to flag anomalies (default threshold: 3 standard deviations).
               - For news (list of strings): Filter out irrelevant or redundant entries based on financial relevance.
            3. Use your judgment to:
               - Flag potential issues (e.g., inconsistent units, unexpected text in numeric fields).
               - Ensure news summaries are concise and finance-related.
            4. Return the cleansed data in its original format (List[Dict] or List[str]) along with a log of actions taken (e.g., "Removed 2 duplicates, normalized 5 numbers").
